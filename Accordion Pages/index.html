                    JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive elements on websites. 
                    It runs in the browser to handle things like animations, form validations, and dynamic content updates.
                    It can also be used on servers with environments like Node.js.

                    Node.js is a server-side runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript on the server.
                    It's efficient for building scalable and high-performance applications due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
                    It's popular for building real-time web applications, such as chat apps and online games.

                    React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications.
                    It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.
                    React uses a virtual DOM to optimize updates, improving performance and making the user experience smoother.
